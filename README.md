This is an angular app. The app uses Cloud firestore as database and Firebase google authentication for authentication of a user. The firebase project is now shut down, therefore you will need to create your own firebase project and set up this angular app to use the app.

**The screenshots of the original webapp can be found in the screenshots folder. This repository is the same app after removing all the data of the event.**
**Kindly open an issue for any kind of support.**

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
